GENERAL IDEAS::
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Castle defense game essentially - bad things fall - click to remove them
- Too many get through it's game over
- Get to the end of a level when everything is destroyed

Ideas for objects
- can be thrown at other objects
- Do more damage than other objects
- Objects that change color - should be clicked at a certain color
- Objects that explode things close by
- Big objects / small objects
- Objects that shouldn't be clicked or they
	- Spawn more enemies
	- immediately attack castle
	- in game stun so nothing can be clicked

Different types of levels
- Make it through a specified time frame - defend castle for one minute
- Limited number of clicks with number of objects
- Colored levels

Have a way to build your castle defenses - earn currency from stars
