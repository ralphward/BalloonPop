~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
RESOLVED BUGSS::
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Runtime bugs when closing scene's too quickly

enemies not removing correctly when restarting level - check timers remove properly

when hitting restart many times causes removeSelf timing bug for enemy table

timers to destroy enemies are not pausing when the level is paused

enemies still being destroyed while game is paused

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GENERAL IDEAS::
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Castle defense game essentially - bad things fall - fire projectile to remove them
- Too many get through it's game over
- Get to the end of a level when everything is destroyed

Ideas for objects
- Do more damage than other objects
- Objects that change color - should be clicked at a certain color
- Objects that explode things close by
- Big objects / small objects
- Objects that shouldn't be clicked or they
	- Spawn more enemies
	- immediately attack castle
	- in game stun so nothing can be clicked

Different types of levels
- Make it through a specified time frame - defend castle for one minute
- Limited number of clicks with number of objects
- Colored levels

Have a way to build your castle defenses - earn currency from stars

clean up game.lua

clean up folder structure

Add an overlay scene that can drop in over the top of the current - for pause / settings etc

projectile path is not removed from scene when required - need a collection to hold the objects

Better firing ability - touch screen is frustrating

Limit the projectiles better
