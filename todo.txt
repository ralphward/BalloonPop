Think of a name

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BUGSS::
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make the missile flight path largely unaffected by balloon collision

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
RESOLVED BUGSS::
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Survival mode can't have infinite objects at the moment - bug when destroying them

Balloons explode in the wrong spot

Runtime bugs when closing scene's too quickly

enemies not removing correctly when restarting level - check timers remove properly

when hitting restart many times removeSelf causes timing bug for enemy table

timers to destroy enemies are not pausing when the level is paused

enemies still being destroyed while game is paused

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GENERAL IDEAS::
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Castle defense game essentially - bad things fall - fire projectile to remove them
- Too many get through it's game over
- Get to the end of a level when everything is destroyed

Ideas for objects
- Do more damage than other objects
- Objects that change color - should be clicked at a certain color
- Objects that explode things close by
- Big objects / small objects
- Objects that shouldn't be clicked or they
	- Spawn more enemies
	- immediately attack castle
	- in game stun so nothing can be clicked

Different types of levels
- Make it through a specified time frame - defend castle for one minute
- Limited number of clicks with number of objects
- Colored levels - more points for redder balloons

Have a way to build your castle defenses - earn currency from stars
 - Fire more bullets at once
 - make bullets piercing
 - 

 Make it through levels to improve abilities - use improved things in survival mode - survival mode is online competition


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DONE::
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add to git

Create git branch

Get level stepping working

Create custom enemies for each level

Add ability to go to main screen from level passed screen

Create high scores for each level

Save high scores for each level

Add particle effects for the balloon popping

Make Balloons explode

Add a pause button

Add a restart button

clean up game.lua

clean up folder structure

Add an overlay scene that can drop in over the top of the current - for pause / settings etc

Add projectile to main game

Have balloons explode on contact

projectile path is not removed from scene when required - need a collection to hold the objects

Better firing ability - touch screen is frustrating

Limit the projectiles better

Use correct collision filters

Add survival mode

Update General ideas to more current idea

Might Need to re structure a little enemies a little - use levelselect as a guide

Configure survival mode so it doesn't use an actual level number...

Add a finish screen for survival mode
